# Library-System
The public library system works to organize the process of borrowing books for members by specifying the duration and information for each book and organizing the information by the library staff.
The administration would be able to hire and fire employees.
Employees will be able to add, delete, display, and search books, and create a bill. 
Members are going to be allowed to search, borrow, and return books and pay bills.
